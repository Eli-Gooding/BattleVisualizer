## Historical Context
The Battle of Cannae, fought on August 2, 216 BC, was a critical engagement in the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), a conflict ignited by Carthage's expansion in Spain. Hannibal Barca, after crossing the Alps in 218 BC with his army and elephants, had already defeated Roman forces at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC). Frustrated by Rome's attrition strategy under Fabius Maximus, the Romans raised an unprecedented army of ~86,400 men under consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro to confront Hannibal, who had seized the Roman supply depot at Cannae.

Rome suffered devastating losses (55,000–70,000 killed, 10,000–15,000 captured), while Carthage lost 5,700–8,000. The defeat led many Roman allies, including Capua, to defect to Carthage. However, Rome's resilience allowed eventual recovery, winning the war at Zama (202 BC). Cannae remains a textbook example of tactical brilliance.
