Product Requirements Document (PRD): Interactive Battle Visualizer

Overview

The Interactive Battle Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to explore historical battles through detailed research, dynamic storytelling, and animated troop movements. Users will input the name of a battle, and the system will generate an interactive experience featuring a structured narrative, maps, and animations.

Objectives

Provide an engaging and accurate visualization of historical battles.

Deliver structured storytelling with accompanying troop movement animations.

Ensure accessibility with voice narration and intuitive navigation.

Features

1. User Input

Users enter the name of a battle into a search field.

The system retrieves data on the battle, including troop compositions, movements, key events, and historical context.

2. Deep Search and Research Compilation

The system performs a comprehensive search for accurate information about the battle.

The research phase gathers:

Key historical events leading to the battle.

Troop compositions and commanders.

Approximate troop movements and engagements.

Outcomes and impact of the battle.

The compiled data is structured into a cohesive narrative.

3. Story Breakdown into Narrative Segments

The battle story is divided into key moments, each forming a segment of the interactive experience.

Each segment contains:

A brief text description.

A corresponding animated troop movement sequence.

A visual map update to reflect the scene.

4. Historical Context Page

Before the battle visualization, an introductory page provides context.

This includes the geopolitical situation, key players, and events leading up to the battle.

5. Interactive Map Representation

A battle map is generated, showing:

Initial troop positions.

Unit divisions as historically accurate as possible.

Units color-coded by army.

Labels indicating unit type and approximate count.

As the battle progresses, the map updates dynamically with animations.

6. Animated Troop Movements

Troop movements are animated step-by-step.

Arrows indicate movements, reinforcements, and retreats.

If new troops arrive, they appear dynamically.

Defeated units fade from the map.

The animations should be smooth and modern, avoiding clutter.

7. Navigation Options

Users can navigate through scenes using:

"Next Scene" and "Previous Scene" buttons.

A timeline or progress indicator.

An overview map for quick scene selection.

8. Voice Narration

Users can choose to have each scene narrated.

The voice should be dynamically generated using a model that mimics documentary-style storytelling (e.g., a deep, dramatic voice like Discovery Channel narrators).

9. Modern UI and Visual Design

The interface should be:

Clean and modern with smooth animations.

Responsive across desktop and mobile devices.

Built using modern UI libraries and frameworks.

Simple yet visually engaging.

Technical Requirements

Frontend

React or Vue.js for UI components.

WebGL/Canvas API for map rendering and animations.

Three.js or D3.js for visualizing troop movements.

Tailwind CSS or Material UI for styling.

Backend

Node.js with Express or Django for API handling.

PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing battle data.

Search and data aggregation using OpenAI APIs or web scraping techniques.

AI and Processing

AI-based text summarization to compile battle reports.

OpenAI's text-to-speech model for narration.

AI-powered map generation and troop movement estimation from historical data.

User Flow

User enters battle name → System performs research.

Historical context page loads → Background of battle is presented.

Initial battle map appears → Troop positions and unit details are displayed.

User progresses through scenes → Narrative unfolds with animated troop movements.

Users can navigate or listen to narration → Interactive elements enhance engagement.

Final battle outcome scene → Summary of results and impact on history.

Conclusion

The Interactive Battle Visualizer aims to combine historical accuracy with engaging storytelling and intuitive visualizations. By leveraging AI and modern UI/UX principles, it provides a unique and educational experience for history enthusiasts and casual users alike.
